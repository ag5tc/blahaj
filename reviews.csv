Bonnie,10/18/2020,4,For the love of sharks...,"Our grandson loves sharks and loved this very cuddly version! Because he plays with it many times each day, his beloved shark is beginning to flatten and lose it's full shape...maybe could use a bit more ""stuffing"" as more are born in the factory!"
rachel4two,07/18/2020,4,We love this shark!!,bought by my 13 and 16 year old kids... Its a huggable pillow too. Its sparsely stuffed so not sure it will last for years but love the design and size.

Hsinyun,02/07/2020,4,Very Comfortable!!!!!!!!!,n/a
SuzInPhilly,01/21/2020,5,We Named Our Shark Bruce,"Bruce, our IKEA shark, is wonderful. Sometimes he's a body pillow or makes watching TV extra comfy. He is such a big hit that we've actually got three now."
Ralphanee,01/13/2020,5,So cute,My son loves this. Set this out with his Christmas gifts. Gorgeous huge and soft.
Happy Mastiff Parent,01/10/2020,5,Super adorable and amazingly durable!,"We originally bought one of these as a gag to see what our mastiff would do as she loves plush toys and dog toys suffered failure within a day. We also loved IKEA's safety factor in that the eyes are embroidered, not plastic, so they are puppy safe as well as kiddo safe. This shark is almost as big as she is. She immediately fell in love with it and carries it with her everywhere. Little does she know that we have a collection of them in the closet because we figured they'd fall apart fairly fast not being a dog toy. In 2 years we've had to replace one because her chompers finally did enough damage that it tore. These are amazing toys and absolutely adorable to boot. Moo would be lost without her giant fishy. I can highly recommend these as both an adorable toy and one that definitely lasts."
tiffy1080,01/08/2020,5,most stolen white elephant gift!,bought this for a white elephant that included both adults and children. it was stolen by both an adult and a child and there were almost tears. highly recommended purchase for any age.
Jantije,01/07/2020,5,Too cute.,"I am a big fan of IKEA's stuffed animals. They are made from soft fabric & filled with soft stuffing. Eyes & other features are embroidered on, so there are no choking hazards for small children. The shark, in particular, is probably one of the largest stuffies they have available. But he's not at all scary quite the opposite. I think he'd charm any small boy or girl - & a lot of adults."
Who Doesnt Love Stuffies,12/28/2019,5,Land Shark!,Clever of our local Ikea to 'randomly' place said sharks around their store in unusual places. We could not resist the adorable shark's pleas to take them home with us!!
iida,12/24/2019,5,What a superb shark,"I got one for my brother, and he immidiately fell in love with him. Our new family member's name is Huihai. The design is very cute, and he looks like a very polite shark. The materials and seams seem pretty high-quality. I like the fact that the eyes are embroidered, since plastic or glass ones would have made hugging the shark less comfortable. This shark is the perfect size for hugging and very soft. I love him so much I also had to get one for myself."
Scifigirl74,12/15/2019,5,His name is Tristen.,"Tristen is the best boy, he has a best friend Istar the monkey. Tristen is hoping for a plush kitten for Christmas. His day job is pillow, therapist, gamer, cook and all around awesome dude."
JINNIE,01/21/2021,5,Best Co-Pilot and Study-Buddy,"I impulse bought my first shark in August to keep me company on my road trip to college, and he has been an indispensable asset to my studies! He squishes up so I can sneak him into the study rooms in the library, he is a better pillow than any actual pillow I’ve ever bought, and his funny face always cheers me up no matter what grade I got on exams! Yesterday I made the 1.5 hour trip to buy another so he can have a friend, and I came home with both the full and small sized sharks! Who would have thought that the best thing Ikea ever made would be their stuffed toys!"
Adwenzel,12/10/2019,5,Best Shark Ever!,"My now 7 year old son has had this shark for at least 4 years. He’s obsessed with it, sleeps with it every night, and it goes on every road trip with us. It washes extremely well and is still in great condition. We did have to add some more stuffing a few months back, but I’m going to say that’s our fault and not because of a subpar product! We are actually going to buy some stuffed animals for our girls for Christmas this year since this one has held up so well!"
Rc111,12/08/2019,5,"Soft, durable",Bought this shark for my friends 2 year old son and he loves it. He wrestles with it and lays on it for a pillow.
paigepowars,11/23/2019,5,the goodest boy,"to this day i still can't believe such a soft, wholesome beauty lives among us. when i wake up every morning, i pray to him. when i'm sad, i cry to him. becuase i know he listens. he's the best boy. the goodest boy, if you will. god, i love blahaj"
verycooldad,11/21/2019,5,Perfect for my son Chad,I purchased a Blåhaj for my son Chad’s birthday. He sleeps with it every night and loves it very much. He even brought it to school one day as part of a costume (devised in order to bring his Blåhaj to school)!! :) very cool product.

Froggiegirl,10/16/2019,5,"Some of the best money I""ve ever spent","About a year ago I took my then 8 year old son to IKEA to buy a Blahaj and ended up also getting one for myself. We have had so much fun with them, taking them on adventures and lazing around the house. They are soft, snuggly, and stay nice looking even if they are a favorite toy. Ours have had several trips through the washer and dryer and are still going strong. Blahaj's are now my go to gift for kid's birthday parties and I've never had a complaint."

Yzzy,07/31/2019,5,Best plush ever!!,"I've wanted this shark for a long time and when IKEA gave me a bday gift card, I used it on this shark. It is THE BEST. Like a body pillow but even better, cause it's a SHARK. Very soft and cuddly, plus it can attack the fiance if needed."

Rami22301,01/16/2019,5,His name is Jet.,"We bought this shark as a last-shark-in-the-bin purchase at a recent outing to IKEA. I tried arguing with my daughter that we didn't need another stuffy in the house, but by the time we were ready to head to the cashiers, our hands had inexplicably gotten completely connected to this big guy. We felt so bad that he'd be the last one in the bin, we bought him. So then we named him Jet, and decided he'd be our family's therapy shark. We argue over who gets to snuggle with him, whose turn it was to snuggle with him, and whether or not he would look better in a baseball hat or in a scarf. (the answer is both. he wants both). He's fluffy, soft, snuggleable, and his eyes don't pop off. His teeth aren't sharp, either."
heynowannie,01/15/2019,5,Jefferies the Shark,My 5 year old loves his shark Jefferies. Beware of his big teeth! They have eaten me on many occasions.

pest54,01/11/2019,5,"A Big, Soft, Cuddly Shark",My 4 year old grandson loves his shark! It's long enough to protect him from head to foot when he sleeps. It's so soft he immediately hugged it. It's a great toy for imaginative play and a comfort for a sleepy child.

Brett D,12/14/2018,5,Best cuddle shark,"The shark is the best for throwing your arm over and getting a good nights sleep. My fiancée got one and I had to get one myself. That’s right. Two sharks, two adults, in a bed. It’s that great."

shoppyshopper,11/29/2018,5,My 5yos favorite thing ever,My 5 year old daughter loves this shark more than anything - she sleeps with it every night and carries it around the house - it makes her feel safe. It is nearly as large as she is. This is a great toy.
FredderMac,11/28/2018,5,Cuddle Monster,"I know what you're thinking: INCREDIBLY VICIOUS SCALY MONSTERS ARE NOT FOR CUDDLING! Well, I have one thing to say to you: NOT SO! This stuffed shark is the tamest, cuddliest, giantest, stuffed-with-fluffest sharky you can find. Bruno (as I've named mine) takes up a whole side of the bed to keep me company, scares off baddies, and saves my life (from gravity and hard objects) when I try to roll off the bed at night! Bruno is a friendy, a besty, and a hero!"
Bacajess,11/28/2018,5,Best thing since Baby Shark!,"I bought this a month ago with the idea that I’d give it to my niece as part of her Christmas present. Nope. Not happening! Sharkie is staying with me and my two fur babies who also love him. His odd expression, plush coat and big mouth have given us hours of enjoyment from cuddles to Instagram posts. Definitely a right shark!"

Kitten22,08/23/2018,5,Loves it!,My 2 year old daughter loves this- it’s huge but not too heavy for her to carry around. Just watch out- we had to talk her out of wanting this as her new crib night night stuffed animal

Amayaelika,08/05/2018,5,My Brucey the shark is a great protector.,"I first saw this while being lost inside ikea and wanted one, I didn't get it at first since I was 27 years old and thought I was too old for plushies but now I don't care anymore. I came back a few weeks later to buy one but it was sold out, then a year later they brought the sharks back. I've named mine Bruce. I bought this when it was $14.99 though they raised the price to $17.99 recently in store. It's about the size of a body pillow, it's a bit floppy and it's amazing. You can wash it in the washing machine if it's big enough though my Bruce's tail became really floppy afterwards."

ginger11,05/02/2018,5,Adorable shark??,"My daughter went right over to this shark in the soft toy section at IKEA and would not put it down! I thought to myself What is she fussing about, it's a shark!. She brought it over to me, and I must say It's adorable, not at all what we are used to thinking about them. Yes it's made to look like a shark, but it's soft and plushy and a beautiful shade of blue! Looking at his pearly whites made us both smile and laugh :D"
Stagl,04/29/2018,5,I ❤️ Sharkie!!!,This guy is my favorite buddy in the bedroom. He's even more popular than my old lady.

Bekka,12/19/2017,5,Very good!,"I bought the sharks for my two nephews ages 5 and 3. They are decorating their new bedrooms with whales and sharks, and these sharks were perfect for bed decorations. I sent the sharks to them for Christmas packed in small boxes hoping they would pop out when they opened them. Their dad let me watch them open the packages on face time. It was fun to watch them open the sharks, and they did pop out at them. As soon as they opened the sharks, they disappeared from the view of face time smacking each other with the sharks. I would say the sharks were a success. My nephews loved them. This was the exact reaction I expected, and they didn't let me down. Hope the sharks survive long enough to see their new home."

SharkLover,10/30/2017,5,BEST SHARKS EVER,I have two of these sharks. My roommate says they are derpy and they totally are but they are amazing. So worth it!
hellomissriot,10/25/2017,5,Can’t get enough!,"I haven’t had “Jaws” for long but, am beyond stoked to add him to my stuffed collection. I have an obsession with Ikea stuffed animals. They’re all very durable and the material is very soft. This one is quite larger than most and also makes for an excellent pillow!"
Rhonda1977,10/23/2017,5,Super Soft,I bought this soft squishy shark for my four year old. He has not put this shark down since he received it. He loves him he takes him everywhere with him and sleeps with him every single night. He is easy to clean and holds up well to my Tiny Terror.
shark fan,10/16/2017,5,The best,I love him. He is very soft and squishy and adorable. He is firm enough in the chest to be perfect for hugging. I’ve bought two now because I have one to a friend then decided I couldn’t be without one for myself. I am one of the many twenty-somethings obsessed with this shark and he is a great friend for customers of any age.
jk99,10/16/2017,5,Great toy,My Kid plays with this shark every day.
nana24,10/16/2017,5,another fantastic IKEA stuffed toy!,"Purchased 4 of these, one for each grandchild (ages 3-7). They all love them. They function as a body pillow when they sleep and, as all IKEA soft toys (we have all the animals), last through rough handling (shark wars!) and machine washing. No plastic parts to pop off, kind features on their faces. IKEA, your stuffed toy animals are the BEST!"
Tillybean,10/16/2017,5,"Love, love, love it!",This stuffed toy is so soft and cuddly! Everyone who sees it wants one.
ErtBert,09/12/2017,5,Super soft!,I got this on an impulse and I have loved it ever since. It adds such whimsy to my room. Plus it's super soft and nice to cuddle!
Blahajluv,08/31/2017,5,I finally found him!,"I love sharks and I missed out on buying him years ago, then I surprisingly found him in stores, I grabbed it immediately and discovered he was so soft and big. I ended up deciding to get 2, one for my bed and the other for my bed at my parents, because I just couldn't imagine my bed without this shark anymore."
What a great shark,08/07/2017,5,Soft,"This thing is so soft. Nice price for its size too. It's extremely huggable. The teeth are a little floppy and I wish they were plush as well but it's still a great product. I'm holding it right now. Like, wow, I love this thing."
